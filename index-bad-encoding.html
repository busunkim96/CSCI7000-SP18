<p>
This is a webpage, identified with the wrong encoding scheme in the head tag: 
</p>
<figure>
<pre><code>
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="ISO-8859-1"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>
		</figure>


<p>
Everything is fine as long as I use characters in the Latin alphabet (which is what ISO-8859-1 was designed to encode).
</p>

But watch what happens when I switch to something else:

æ»≥Á«œººø‰. ¿Ã∞‘ πª±Óø‰?
<p>
You have no idea what I wrote! You can try switching through encodings until you find one that will make it work. (This option is only 
available in some browsers through a "text encodings" menu. 

Now, try going to this webpage, encoded with UTF-8:

<a href = "index-utf8-encoding.html">Page encoded with UTF-8</a>
</p>
</body>
</html>
